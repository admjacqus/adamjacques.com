Portfolio Project
=========================

Quick site for the porttolio.

## Quick Start ##

 - Assets (JS, SASS) should be stored in the `src/` directory.
 
 - Assets are combined and minified and stored for use in `/dist/` - files here should not be modified as they will be overwritten.

 - NPM packages should be installed before developing within the project, run `npm install` to do this. 
 
 - Gulp and live-server should be installed globally by running `npm install -g gulp live-server`

 - To build the assets run and start the live server `gulp` in the root directory of the project.

 - Images should be stored under `/images/`
